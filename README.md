## 🎯 COMPLETE STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE FOR ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS

### **STEP 1: Install Python** 🐍

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. Click **"Download Python 3.11"** (big yellow button)
4. Run the installer
5. **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Check the box "Add Python to PATH"
6. Click "Install Now"
7. Wait for installation to complete

**Verify Installation:**
Open PowerShell and type:
```powershell
python --version
pip --version
```

You should see something like:
```
Python 3.11.x
pip 23.x.x
```

---

### **STEP 2: Navigate to Your Project** 📂

Open PowerShell and type:

```powershell
cd d:\projects\DevOps\student-feedback\backend
```

---

### **STEP 3: Install Required Packages** 📦

Still in the `backend` folder, type:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs:
- Flask (web framework)
- pytest (testing tool)
- pytest-flask (Flask testing helper)

**Wait for it to finish** (takes 1-2 minutes)

---

### **STEP 4: Run the Backend Server** 🚀

In the same PowerShell window:

```powershell
python app.py
```

✅ **SUCCESS!** You should see:
```
🚀 Starting Student Feedback API...
📝 API will be available at http://localhost:5000
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000
```

**🎉 Your server is now running!**

---

### **STEP 5: Test Your API** 🧪

**Option A: Using Web Browser**
1. Open your browser
2. Go to: http://localhost:5000
3. You'll see API information in JSON format!

**Option B: Using PowerShell (Open a NEW PowerShell window)**

Test if API is working:
```powershell
curl http://localhost:5000
```

Get all feedback (empty at first):
```powershell
curl http://localhost:5000/feedback
```

Add new feedback:
```powershell
$body = @{
    student_name = "John Doe"
    comment = "Great course! Very helpful."
    rating = 5
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5000/feedback" -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

---

### **STEP 6: Open the Beautiful Web Interface** 🎨

1. Keep the server running (from Step 4)
2. Open File Explorer
3. Navigate to: `d:\projects\DevOps\student-feedback\frontend`
4. **Double-click** `index.html`
5. It opens in your browser! 🎉

Now you can:
- ✅ Submit feedback through a beautiful form
- ✅ See all feedback in real-time
- ✅ Delete feedback
- ✅ See statistics

---

### **STEP 7: Run Tests** ✅

Open a **NEW PowerShell** window:

```powershell
cd d:\projects\DevOps\student-feedback\backend
pytest tests/ -v
```

This runs all unit tests and shows results:
```
test_home_endpoint PASSED
test_health_endpoint PASSED
test_add_feedback_success PASSED
... (and more)
```

**Run tests with coverage:**
```powershell
pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-report=term
```

---

## 🐳 DOCKER SETUP (Advanced)

### **Install Docker Desktop**

1. Go to: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
2. Download **Docker Desktop for Windows**
3. Install it (requires restart)
4. Open Docker Desktop and wait for it to start

### **Build Docker Image**

Open PowerShell in `d:\projects\DevOps\student-feedback`:

```powershell
cd d:\projects\DevOps\student-feedback
docker build -t student-feedback:latest .
```

This creates a Docker image with your app inside!

### **Run Docker Container**

```powershell
docker run -p 5000:5000 student-feedback:latest
```

Your app is now running in a container! 🐳

### **Test Docker Container**

```powershell
curl http://localhost:5000
```

### **Stop Docker Container**

Press `Ctrl + C` in the PowerShell window.
