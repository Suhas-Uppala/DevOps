# 🚀 Deployment Guide - Authentication Flow

## ✅ Authentication Flow Fixed!

### How It Works Now:

1. **Landing Page** (`home.html`) - Smart redirect
   - Checks if user is logged in
   - If YES → redirects to `index.html` (main app)
   - If NO → redirects to `auth.html` (login/register)

2. **Auth Page** (`auth.html`) - Login/Register
   - User can register new account
   - User can login with credentials
   - After successful login → redirects to `index.html`

3. **Main Page** (`index.html`) - Feedback System
   - Checks authentication on load
   - If not logged in → redirects to `auth.html`
   - If logged in → shows feedback system with username
   - Logout button redirects back to `auth.html`

## 🌐 Deployment Options

### **Option 1: Use home.html as Entry Point (Recommended)**

Share this link: `https://your-domain.com/home.html`

This will automatically route users:
- New users → auth.html (register/login)
- Logged-in users → index.html (main app)

### **Option 2: Use auth.html as Entry Point**

Share this link: `https://your-domain.com/auth.html`

Users will see the login page first:
- Register or login
- Automatically redirected to main app

### **Option 3: Use index.html as Entry Point**

Share this link: `https://your-domain.com/index.html`

Users will be redirected to auth.html if not logged in:
- Auto-redirect to login
- After login, return to main app

## 📁 File Structure

```
frontend/
├── home.html          # Smart landing page (NEW - Recommended entry point)
├── auth.html          # Login/Register page
└── index.html         # Main feedback app (protected)
```

---

## 🔄 User Journey

### **First-Time User:**
```
1. Visit home.html
2. → Redirected to auth.html (no token found)
3. Click "Register" tab
4. Fill in username, password
5. Click "Register"
6. Success message shown
7. Switched to "Login" tab
8. Enter credentials
9. Click "Login"
10. → Redirected to index.html
11. ✅ Can use feedback system!
```

### **Returning User:**
```
1. Visit home.html
2. → Redirected to index.html (token found)
3. ✅ Immediately in the app!
4. Username shown in header
5. Can submit/view/delete feedback
```

### **Logout Flow:**
```
1. Click "Logout" button (top-right)
2. Token removed from localStorage
3. → Redirected to auth.html
4. Must login again to access
```

## 🛠️ Deployment Steps

### **Step 1: Update Your Deployment**

If deploying to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.:

1. Set `home.html` as your index/entry file
2. OR rename `home.html` to `index.html` (and rename current index.html to `dashboard.html`)

### **Step 2: Update All References**

If you rename files, update these references:

**In auth.html (line 417):**
```javascript
window.location.href = 'dashboard.html'; // if you renamed index.html
```

**In dashboard.html (formerly index.html):**
```javascript
// Line where it redirects to auth
window.location.href = 'auth.html'; // keep as is

// Logout function
window.location.href = 'auth.html'; // keep as is
```

### **Step 3: Test the Flow**

1. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()` in console
2. Visit your deployment URL
3. Should redirect to auth.html
4. Register → Login → Should redirect to main app
5. Refresh → Should stay on main app
6. Logout → Should redirect to auth.html

## 🌟 Recommended Deployment Configuration

### **Option A: Keep Current Names**

**Entry Point:** `home.html`

Pros:
- No file renames needed
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to understand

Cons:
- URL will be `yoursite.com/home.html` instead of just `yoursite.com`

### **Option B: Rename for Clean URLs**

**Renames:**
- `home.html` → `index.html` (becomes entry point)
- `index.html` → `dashboard.html` (main app)
- `auth.html` → stays as `auth.html`

**Then update all references:**
```javascript
// In auth.html line 417:
window.location.href = 'dashboard.html';

// In dashboard.html (check authentication):
window.location.href = 'auth.html';

// In dashboard.html (logout):
window.location.href = 'auth.html';
```

Pros:
- Clean URL: `yoursite.com` automatically loads correct page
- Professional appearance

Cons:
- Requires file renames and reference updates

## ✅ Current Status

**What's Working:**
- ✅ `index.html` redirects to `auth.html` if not logged in
- ✅ `auth.html` redirects to `index.html` after successful login
- ✅ `home.html` intelligently routes users based on login status
- ✅ Logout button redirects to `auth.html`
- ✅ Token-based authentication working

**Recommended Action:**
Use `home.html` as your entry point when sharing the link!

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Open `home.html` without login → Should redirect to `auth.html`
- [ ] Register a new account → Should show success
- [ ] Login with credentials → Should redirect to `index.html`
- [ ] Refresh `index.html` → Should stay on page (token valid)
- [ ] Try to access `index.html` directly (after logout) → Should redirect to `auth.html`
- [ ] Click logout button → Should redirect to `auth.html`
- [ ] Open `home.html` after login → Should redirect to `index.html`

---

## 📝 Quick Reference

**Entry Points:**
- `home.html` - Smart redirect (recommended)
- `auth.html` - Direct to login
- `index.html` - Protected, auto-redirect

**User Actions:**
- Register → Login → Main App
- Logout → Auth Page
- Refresh → Stays logged in (24 hours)

**Token Storage:**
- `localStorage.authToken` - JWT token
- `localStorage.username` - Username
- Both removed on logout

---

## 🎯 For Your GitHub Pages/Railway Deployment

**Share this URL format:**
```
https://your-username.github.io/DevOps/student-feedback/frontend/home.html
```

OR if you rename `home.html` to `index.html`:
```
https://your-username.github.io/DevOps/student-feedback/frontend/
```

**Users will automatically:**
1. See login page if not authenticated
2. See main app if already logged in
3. Be redirected appropriately on logout

---

## 🎉 Summary

✅ **Authentication flow is now complete and working!**

**Entry Flow:**
- New visitors → Login page
- Logged-in users → Main app

**Exit Flow:**
- Logout → Return to login page
- Can login again anytime

**Use `home.html` as your main deployment link for the best experience!**
